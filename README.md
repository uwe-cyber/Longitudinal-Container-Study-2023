# Longitudinal-Container-Study-2023

This github repo contains the data collected and used during our longitudinal study of containers for our paper **Longitudinal Risk-based Security Assessment of Docker Software Container Images**.

This data has been made freely available for use both to provide additional context to the publication itself and for further research.

The container images used during this study can also be freely accessed and downloaded from our Docker Hub.

Images were downloaded and added to separate DockerHub repositories (one per analysis period) to ensure that an exact clone could be retrieved at a later date if required for the purposes of this research, and to ensure that no external changes had occurred in the software source code. The three analysis stages were completed in July 2022, October 2022, and January 2023.
